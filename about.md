I am a fourth-year graduate student. I grew up in Seattle. I like to golf, read, and play softball in my spare time, and am an aspiring yet inept second violin in the Madison Community Orchestra.  

I am the Forrest Gump of the Seattle Mariners, as I've been lucky enough to be present for The Double, Randy Johnson's 19K game, Ichiro's first hit, and 3 of their 4 no-hitters. I <a href=""{{ site.baseurl }}/images/felix_perfect_visitors.jpg">kept score</a> for one of them, and was listening on the radio for the one I missed (Bosio '93).
