title: Indexing Memories Better

I realised I've been having memory blanks in the thoughts I have on things I read,
secondary research topics, and just about anything else that does not have to do with my
primary research. The symptom manifests as this feeling that I know I had some thought(s)
about a certain matter, consequential ones that I would like to remember, but being
unable to extract that specific memory from within.
 
So I've decided to write things down here before they slip away, which probably means more
frequent posts that closely resemble me on Twitter, but without the 140-character chains.
