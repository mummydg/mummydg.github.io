title: Career Update
---

Some career news -- I've graduated from the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, and am now a post-doc at the <a href = "https://sites.duke.edu/driehuyslab/">Driehuys Lab</a> in the Center for In Vivo Microscopy and Department of Radiology at Duke University in Durham, NC.

Not to worry! I'll still be working on applications of hyperpolarized gas MRI to lung disease.
