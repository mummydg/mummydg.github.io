I'm coauthor on the "Asthma" chapter on the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperpolarized-Inert-Gas-MRI-Application-ebook/dp/B01M7XVJAS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1481950579&sr=8-2&keywords=hyperpolarized+gas+mri">Hyperpolarized and Inert Gas MRI: From Technology to Application in Research and Medicine"</a>. Pick up your copy today! Or, you know, get it from the library or something.
