I have spent most of my life in the Seattle area and moved to Wisconsin for grad school. In my spare time, I play softball, golf, and at least three kinds of racquet sports, and am an aspiring yet ultimately disappointing violinist.

Here is my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/felix_perfect_visitors.jpg">scorecard</a> from Felix Hernandez's perfect game in 2012.

I read <a href = "bit.ly/2MY7sMM">books</a>, sometimes watch
 <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/davidmummy">movies</a>,
and I'll happily play you in online <a href ="https://lichess.org/@/mummydg">chess</a>.
