I have spent most of my life in the Seattle area and moved to Wisconsin for grad school. In my spare time, I play softball, golf, follow the Seattle Mariners, and am an aspiring yet inept second violin in the <a href="http://www.madisoncommunityorchestra.org/">Madison Community Orchestra</a>.

I am a member of the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">Union of Concerned Scientists</a>.
