I am a post-doctoral research associate at Duke. I grew up in Seattle, attended Whitman College in Walla Walla, WA*, and did my graduate work at the University of Wisconsin -- Madison.

My hobbies include tennis, languages, playing baseball & softball, watching the Carolina Hurricanes, talking about electric cars, and playing that spelling bee game on the NYT app. I'm interested in evolving strategies and statistics in the MLB. Here is my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/felix_perfect_visitors.jpg">scorecard</a> from Felix Hernandez's perfect game in 2012.

I have an ever-growing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2SLqGJgTeSdgfPUCh9K5ml?si=_o68yjrDT5e5WyzfQVoXXA">old-time-style country music playlist</a> on Spotify.

I read <a href = "bit.ly/2MY7sMM">books</a> and sometimes watch <a href = "http://letterboxd.com/davidmummy">movies</a>,.
