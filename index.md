I am a second year PhD student at [Carnegie Mellon University's][12]
[Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy][13].
I spent the first year of my PhD in the [Department of Computer Science][14]
at [Stony Brook University][9].

I work with [Leman Akoglu][10] on mining and modeling structured data. I have recently
begun incorporating microeconomic theory into my models and methods to better address
public policy questions with an economic focus.

I received a master's in computer science from [KAUST][2], where I was part of the
[InfoCloud group][1]. I defended my thesis on the theoretical problem of
[scheduling broadcasts in a network of timelines][11] to a committee consisting of
[Panos Kalnis][3] (chair, databases), [Xiangliang Zhang][5] (machine learning) and
[Antoine Vigneron][15] (theoretical computer science).

In a previous life, I was a software engineer at [Yahoo!][6] where I was fortunate to
work with the [Timesense](/yahoo/) team on large-scale streaming NLP.
Before that, I was an undergraduate at [BITS - Pilani, Goa Campus][4].
